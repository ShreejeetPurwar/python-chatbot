# Python Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot application built with Python and the OpenAI API. The chatbot communicates with users through the command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- An OpenAI API key (register for one at https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

\\\bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreejeetPurwar/python-chatbot.git
cd python-chatbot
\\\

2. Install the required packages:

\\\bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\\\

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

Copy your API key from the OpenAI website and set it as an environment variable:

\\\bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
\\\

## Usage

Run the chatbot:

\\\bash
python chatbot.py
\\\

To start a conversation with the chatbot, simply type your message and press Enter. The chatbot will generate a response and display it on the screen. To exit the chat, type "quit" or "exit" and press Enter.

## Customization

You can modify the `chatbot.py` file to change the behavior of the chatbot or to incorporate additional features. For example, you can adjust the temperature parameter to control the randomness of the generated responses.
